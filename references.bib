abstract = {Let a partial deterministic finite automaton be a DFA in which each state need not have a transition edge for each letter of the alphabet. We demonstrate that the smallest partial DFA for the set of all subwords of a given word w, |w|>2, has at most 2|w|−2 states and 3|w|−4 transition edges, independently of the alphabet size. We give an algorithm to build this smallest partial DFA from the input w on-line in linear time.}

abstract = {An algorithm was developed which facilitates the search for similarities between newly determined amino acid sequences and sequences already available in databases. Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replaceability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).}}

abstract="Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field that aims to analyze biological data through computational approaches. In the last years, the evolution of technological resources has provided a tidal wave of biological data. Consequently, an unprecedented amount of studies using bioinformatics approaches have been released, increasing peer-reviewed published papers. Here, we tell a brief history of bioinformatics based on literature data analysis and visualization. We collected abstracts and other metadata from papers published from 1998 to 2019 in four leading bioinformatics journals: (i) Oxford Bioinformatics; (ii) BMC Bioinformatics; (iii) Briefings in Bioinformatics; and (iv) PLoS Computational Biology. Our results show an increase in publication number and international collaborations. We also observed an increase in publications by Chinese authors. Latin America continues to have a low percentage of global scientific bioinformatics production. However, Brazil excels in this region, being responsible for almost half of Latin America papers published. Our results also point out the recent trend of using Python as the programming language for bioinformatics applications, followed by Perl, Java, and R. We hope these data visualizations can provide insights to understand the recent changes and evolution in the bioinformatics field.
