abstract = {Let a partial deterministic finite automaton be a DFA in which each state need not have a transition edge for each letter of the alphabet. We demonstrate that the smallest partial DFA for the set of all subwords of a given word w, |w|>2, has at most 2|w|−2 states and 3|w|−4 transition edges, independently of the alphabet size. We give an algorithm to build this smallest partial DFA from the input w on-line in linear time.}

abstract = {An algorithm was developed which facilitates the search for similarities between newly determined amino acid sequences and sequences already available in databases. Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replaceability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).}}

abstract="Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field that aims to analyze biological data through computational approaches. In the last years, the evolution of technological resources has provided a tidal wave of biological data. Consequently, an unprecedented amount of studies using bioinformatics approaches have been released, increasing peer-reviewed published papers. Here, we tell a brief history of bioinformatics based on literature data analysis and visualization. We collected abstracts and other metadata from papers published from 1998 to 2019 in four leading bioinformatics journals: (i) Oxford Bioinformatics; (ii) BMC Bioinformatics; (iii) Briefings in Bioinformatics; and (iv) PLoS Computational Biology. Our results show an increase in publication number and international collaborations. We also observed an increase in publications by Chinese authors. Latin America continues to have a low percentage of global scientific bioinformatics production. However, Brazil excels in this region, being responsible for almost half of Latin America papers published. Our results also point out the recent trend of using Python as the programming language for bioinformatics applications, followed by Perl, Java, and R. We hope these data visualizations can provide insights to understand the recent changes and evolution in the bioinformatics field.

abstract = {Suffix automata and factor automata are efficient data structures for representing the full index of a set of strings. They are minimal deterministic automata representing the set of all suffixes or substrings of a set of strings. This paper presents a novel analysis of the size of the suffix automaton or factor automaton of a set of strings. It shows that the suffix automaton or factor automaton of a set of strings U has at most 2Q−2 states, where Q is the number of nodes of a prefix-tree representing the strings in U. This bound significantly improves over 2‖U‖−1, the bound given by Blumer et al. [A. Blumer, J. Blumer, D. Haussler, R.M. McConnell, A. Ehrenfeucht, Complete inverted files for efficient text retrieval and analysis, Journal of the ACM 34 (1987) 578–589], where ‖U‖ is the sum of the lengths of all strings in U. More generally, we give novel and general bounds for the size of the suffix or factor automaton of an automaton as a function of the size of the original automaton and the maximal length of a suffix shared by the strings it accepts. We also describe in detail a linear-time algorithm for constructing the suffix automaton S or factor automaton F of U in time O(|S|). Our algorithm applies in fact to any input suffix-unique automaton and strictly generalizes the standard on-line construction of a suffix automaton for a single input string. Our algorithm can also be used straightforwardly to generate the suffix oracle or factor oracle of a set of strings, which has been shown to have various useful properties in string-matching. Our analysis suggests that the use of factor automata of automata can be practical for large-scale applications, a fact that is further supported by the results of our experiments applying factor automata to a music identification task with more than 15,000 songs.}

abstract = {The suffix tree is one of the most important data structures in string processing and comparative genomics. However, the space consumption of the suffix tree is a bottleneck in large scale applications such as genome analysis. In this article, we will overcome this obstacle. We will show how every algorithm that uses a suffix tree as data structure can systematically be replaced with an algorithm that uses an enhanced suffix array and solves the same problem in the same time complexity. The generic name enhanced suffix array stands for data structures consisting of the suffix array and additional tables. Our new algorithms are not only more space efficient than previous ones, but they are also faster and easier to implement.}
