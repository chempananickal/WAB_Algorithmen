\section{Choice of Central Tendency}
The data collected seems to be heavily right-skewed, with some outliers. This is irrespective of the scenario, string length, algorithm, 
or even the type of measurement (build time, query time, total time, or memory usage).

This is likely due to cache misses, other background processes running on the computer, 
or other random factors that can affect the performance of the algorithms in a non-deterministic way.
Therefore, the median was chosen as the measure of central tendency for the results, 
as the data is not normally distributed and the median is more robust to outliers than the mean.
And since the median is being used, the interquartile range (IQR) was chosen as the measure of variability.

\section{Time}
The time taken to construct the \acrshort{sam} and the \acrshort{esa} and to find the \acrshort{lcs} was measured for each scenario and string length, 
and the results are shown in the following plots.
